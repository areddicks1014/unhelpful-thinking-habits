      <h1>Why I Made This</h1>
      <p>My counselor noticed that I seemed to default to certain ways of thinking about myself. She gave me a two-sided handout with useful and, most importantly, actionable information. However, the inconvenience of having to carry around a sheet of paper with you overrides the usefulness.</p>
      <p>Since I know I won't be carrying it around with me, I bet others won't either. So I made it into a small PWA (Progressive Web App) using <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/" target="_blank" class="text-theme-gradient">Polymer</a>. It will also be <a href="https://github.com/areddicks1014/unhelpful-thinking-habits" target="_blank" class="text-theme-gradient">open-source</a> so that others can see how it's made and learn from it. <a href="mailto:areddicks1014@gmail.com" class="text-theme-gradient">Feedback</a> is always welcome.</p>
      <p>I hope this small tool helps someone out there in need of a little self-help. I know I need it from time to time.</p>
